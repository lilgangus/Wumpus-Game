# Wumpus-Game
 
This is a terminal game, hunt the Wumpus, where the user has to find the gold and escape the maze from the same room they entered in. In the maze there are obstacles such as bats that cause the user to move in the opposite direction for 5 moves and stalactites that have a 75% chance of falling on the user and killing them. The user has one life but there is a armor room that gives the user invincibility from one game ending event. When the user is adjacent to a room with an event, a message will be displayed to the user alerting to the corresponding room. The user also starts out with 3 arrows that can be fired in any direction to attempt to kill the Wumpus. 

To play the game, run the makefile, then run the executable file named "game".
